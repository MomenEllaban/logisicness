                            <br>
                            Ever wondered how fresh food and medicine get shipped around the world? Special refrigerated
                            containers, called reefer containers, are the answer. These high-tech boxes act like giant
                            refrigerators, maintaining a constant temperature, airflow,humidity, and drainage inside.
                            This controlled environment ensures delicate items like fruits, vegetables, and medications
                            stay safe and last longer.

                            <br>
                            Reefer containers are essential for businesses that deal with temperature-sensitive
                            products. No matter how hot or cold it gets outside, the reefer container keeps the inside
                            at the perfect temperature. This is crucial for maintaining the quality and safety of
                            perishables.

                            <br>
                            Global demand for fresh food drives reefer container use

                            <br>
                            As people around the world crave fresh, high-quality food, the need for reliable shipping
                            methods has grown. Here at Logisticness, we understand that each type of food requires

                            Warehousing: A vital stop on your product's journey

                            <br>
                            Warehousing plays a critical role in the supply chain, acting as a temporary home for your
                            goods before they reach their final destination. It bridges the gap between shipping stages,
                            providing a secure and organized space to store your cargo.

                            <br>
                            Warehousing ensures your products are safe and sound before they hit the road or sea.
                            Warehouses are designed to keep your cargo protected from external threats, with items
                            meticulously organized on pallets and bins for easy access and tracking.

                            Finding the perfect fit: Different warehousing options

                            <br>
                            The type of warehouse you choose depends on your specific needs. Here are two main options
                            to consider:
                            •

                            <br>
                            Public Warehousing: This is a cost-effective option where you rent a portion of a shared
                            warehouse space. This is ideal if you have a smaller volume of goods or fluctuating storage
                            requirements. The space allocation is typically based on your cargo's weight (CBM) or
                            weight.
                            •
                            •

                            <br>
                            Private Warehousing: This option provides you with exclusive use of an entire warehouse.
                            This is a good choice for businesses with high-volume inventory or specific storage
                            requirements, such as temperature control or specialized security measures. Private
                            warehouses are typically rented through contracts based on your specific needs and shipment
                            volume.
